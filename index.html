    <h2> A SHORT HISTORY OF KINGSWAY COLLEGE </h2>
    <p>
    Kingsway College's history began in the fall of 1903 in Lorne Park, a beautiful fruit farming area fifteen miles west of Toronto. 
    By 1911, larger buildings and more equipment were necessary to meet the needs of the growing student body, and after some deliberation, the present site in Oshawa was chosen.
